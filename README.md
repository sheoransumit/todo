# todo

Download angular seed project and change template and controller accordinly.
Read w3school angularjs to get idea about directives- ng-App, ng-model, ng-bind and expressions. 
Also read modules, controller, validation, router etc.
update gitignore to exclude tests for now.
Include factories to make data transfer feasible between components.

#improvements

Tasks can be given id and on click navigate to task/:id.
Include frameworks for UI, tables; rather than writing everything in angularJS, just like we moved from javascript to angular.. here apis of dependencies will be used to make task easier.
Include tests.
